# Data Visualisation Coursework - Task Description

This repository contains my solution for the Data Visualisation coursework module at King's College London.

## Task Description
The aim of the project was to demonstrate understanding of the following areas:
 - Formulate research questions and produce visualizations to get insight into the quetion area to address them.
 - Implementing interactive visualizations using D3 and using data processing techniques.
 - Communicating findings and insights through informative visual representations and written report.

The assignment is divided into three parts: Analytics, Design and Prototyping, and Implementation
- Analytics
  - Coming up with self research questions to explore the dataset.
  - Assessing datasets that can be used to answer research questions.
- Design and Prototyping
  - Designing visualizations that would answer the research questions proposed.
  - Justifying the design visualisations.
- Implementation
  - Description of how data is processed.
  - Visualisation allows user interaction.
